Generate a diverse set of test certificates using OpenSSL
Store test certificates in a version-controlled repository
Use parameterized tests to run scenarios with different certificate variations
Implement a factory pattern to create various certificate types and configurations
Security & Performance Considerations
Ensuring Strong Cryptographic Standards:

Enforce minimum key sizes (e.g., RSA 2048+, ECC 256+)
Use only approved algorithms (e.g., SHA-256 for signatures)
Regularly update test suite to include newer standards and deprecate older ones
Validate against known weak keys or compromised CAs
Measuring Efficiency of Certificate Validation:

Implement performance tests to measure validation time
Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in validation process
Benchmark against industry standards for acceptable validation times
Test with varying loads to ensure scalability of validation process
